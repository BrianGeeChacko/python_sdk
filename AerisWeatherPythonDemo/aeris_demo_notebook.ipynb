    "# AerisWeather Python SDK\n",
    "----  \n",
    " \n",
    "The AerisWeather Python SDK is a coding toolkit created to streamline integrating data from the [AerisWeather API](https://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/api/) into Python applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the goal of the SDK is to make it easier to get weather data into your Python app. While working towards that goal, we also tried to make the SDK as \"Pythonic\" as possible, embracing some of our favorite core tenets of the [Zen of Python (PEP20)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id3):\n",
    "- Simple is better than complex.\n",
    "- Readability counts.\n",
    "- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks for checking out the AerisWeather Python SDK. We hope you find it useful, and enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed creating it!  \n",
    "\n",
    "*The AerisWeather Python Team*  \n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloads\n",
    "The full SDK containing the library, docs and demos is available for download from the project's GitHub page, or from the [Toolkits section](https://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/toolkits/) of the AerisWeather site.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want just the library, that's available all by itself on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/). Most likely though, you'll just want to install it via pip (see Installation in the Getting Started section below).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Python v3.6 or higher.\n",
    "- An active AerisWeather API subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Don't have an active AerisWeather API client account?   \n",
    "Accessing the API data requires an active AerisWeather API subscription, and registration of your application or namespace. You can sign up for a free developer account at the [AerisWeather Sign Up page](https://www.aerisweather.com/signup/) to get your client ID and secret.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### License\n",
    "This SDK is provided free of charge for AerisWeather's customers, and is available for use by them under the [MIT open source](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SDK Contents\n",
    "- Core Library/Package  \n",
    "The AerisWeather Python SDK includes a core Python library that provides simplified fetching and parsing of data from the API, written in Python v3.6.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unit Tests  \n",
    "The SDK incudes a full set of unit tests, which are a great source of sample code for accessing the API endpoints. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docs  \n",
    "A full set of HTML code documentation is provided, outlining class and method structure. More documentation can be found at aerisweather.com, and on the project's GitHub page.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demo Project File  \n",
    "AerisWeatherPythonDemo is a Python file containing examples demonstrating a few ways to use the aerisweather package to get data from the AerisWeather API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook  \n",
    "Also in the AerisWeatherPythonDemo folder is a Jupyter Notebook. This is another source of example code. The notebook allows you to experiment with various methods of accessing the API without having to run the demo project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Readme  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- License file  \n",

    "## Getting Started  \n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download the SDK  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already downloaded the SDK, see the Downloads section above and get the SDK and all it's contents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Demo File or Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the main SDK folder, you'll see the AerisWeatherPythonDemo folder. This folder contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- aeris_demo.py\n",
    "- aeris_demo_notebook.ipynb  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first, aeris_demo.py is a simple Python file. The other is a Jupyter notebook. Both of these resources contain the same sample code, so you can choose to use either or both to learn more about how the aerisweather library works.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that whichever path you choose to follow, you will need to install the aerisweather package to the Python environment that supports that resource. We used PyCharm during the creation of the SDK, and used it to run the aeris_demo.py project as well as initialize our Jupyter Kernel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install the aerisweather Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's get the aerisweather package installed to your Python environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To use pip for the installation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install -U --index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ aerisweather==#.#.#  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using PyCharm:  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using PyCharm as your IDE, go to Settings | Project Interpreter and click the green \"+\" in the upper right. Search for aerisweather and choose to install the package to your Python environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: If you're also initializing the Jupyter Kernel from PyCharm, this step will cover that too.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set The AerisWeather API Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in both the aeris_demo.py file and the aeris_demo_notebook Jupyter notebook file, the import section has a reference to a \"keys\" module.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    from keys import client_id, client_secret, app_id  \n",
    "\n",
    "The import statement also references client_id and client_secret. These are the AerisWeather API credentials mentioned previously in the Requirements section. The final reference is the application id, which should be the namespace or domain of the application from which you will be accessing the API.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you don't have an active AerisWeather API account, check out the Requirements section and get signed up before continuing.* \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the keys.py file(s), replace the placeholders with your AerisWeather API client id and secret, and the appropriate namespace or domain for your Python application.\n"
